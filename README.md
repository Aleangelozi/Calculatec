# Calculatec

My very first app!

This is the very first app I developed using Java. I made it in 2018. 
It was very exciting to write and to see something that 
I coded working on my cellphone. 

It's  a very simple calculator, and it certainly needs improvements
in order to work as a proper calculator, but I got a good picture of
the basics of how to develop an app using Java.
